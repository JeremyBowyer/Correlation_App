## Filters

#### Value
You provide a column, a minimum and a maximum value. The app will then filter your dataset to only include the rows where the value in the given column is within those bounds, inclusive.

#### Percentile
You provide a column and a percentile range. The app will then filter your dataset to only include the rows where the value in the given column is within that range of percentiles, inclusive. For example, if you want to weed out rows with the highest 5% of values in that column, you could set the range to be 0 - 0.95.

#### Date
You provide a column (date), minimum and maximum dates, and a date format (see <a href="http://www.statmethods.net/input/dates.html" target="_blank">here</a> for how to interpret date formats). The app will then filter your dataset to only include the rows where the date in the given date column is within that range of dates, inclusive.
